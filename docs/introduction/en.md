# DicoGIS: the 3-clic geodata dictionary

Or how to easily get detailed and structured information about its GIS data in a few minutes.
Introducing a simple tool without any pretention except give a hand to GIS fellows to manage data.

## In a nutshell

[DicoGIS](https://github.com/Guts/DicoGIS) creates an Excel workbook (2003) with technical metadata gathered from geographic data (files and PostGIS database). Available as a Python script (see requirements below) or as a Windows executable without installation required, so you can use take it on a USB device for example.

Some useful cases:

- you receive a dark database of files and you would like to know what there's inside;
- before you deliver your geographic data to a non-specialist superior / colleague / client / partner / alien you want to give a description of data trasmitted, just because it's a good practice and you are a good GIS person.


For the story, I started to develop DicoGIS in complement of [Metadator](https://github.com/Guts/Metadator) and I continue using it until today.

## Technical specifications

Formats handled are potentially the entire list of [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html) and [OGR](http://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html) but for now I just implemented these ones:

- vectors: shapefile, MapInfo tables, GeoJSON, GML, KML
- rasters: ECW, GeoTIFF, JPEG
- "flat" databases: Esri File GDB, Spatialite
- CAD: DWG (only listing), DXF
- Map documents: Geospatial PDF

DicoGIS is localized in [3 languages (Fran√ßais, Anglais et Espagnol)](https://github.com/Guts/DicoGIS/tree/master/data/locale) but every one can add a translation or custom the existing texts/labels.

Talking about perforamnces, it's always very dependant on the computer but to give an idea, it needs 30 seconds for:

- 40 vectors,
- 10 rasters (which represent like 90 Mo in total),
- 7 FileGDB contenant sixty vectors,
- and some DXF.

## How to use it

1/ Download the latest version:

* [the executable Windows](https://github.com/Guts/DicoGIS/releases),
* [source code](https://github.com/Guts/DicoGIS/archive/master.zip).

2/ Unzip it and launch DicoGIS.exe / DicoGIS.py

3/ Switch language as you need

4/a For files:

- Pick the parent folder where you data is stored: listing starts and progress bar is moving until the end of listing
- Choose the expected formats

4/b For PostgreSQL / PostGIS (database), it's more or less the same story but you have to give the connection settings:

![DicoGIS - Processing PostGIS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Guts/DicoGIS/master/doc/06_DicoGIS_PostGIS.gif "DicoGIS - Processing PostGIS")

5/ Launch and wait: save the output file where you want.

6/ Have a look to the output file and apply some Excel enhancements (convert to a newer version if you have, use a default style, etc.) and the log file DicoGIS.log (there is a lot of information inside it, believe me ^^).


## What about the results?

The output workbook contains technical metadata about the data found, organized in tabs corresponding on the type of data. Have a look to the [matrix I did to see what information according the formats](https://github.com/Guts/DicoGIS/blob/master/doc/InfosByFormats_matrix.md).
