# DicoGIS: the 3-clic geodata dictionary

Or how to easily get detailed and structured information about its GIS data in a few minutes.
Introducing a simple tool without any pretention except give a hand to GIS fellows to manage data.

## In a nutshell

[DicoGIS](https://github.com/Guts/DicoGIS) creates an Excel workbook (2003) with technical metadata gathered from geographic data (files and PostGIS database). Available as a Python script (see requirements below) or as a Windows executable without installation required, so you can use take it on a USB device for example.

Some useful cases:

- you receive a dark database of files and you would like to know what there's inside;
- before you deliver your geographic data to a non-specialist superior / colleague / client / partner / alien you want to give a description of data trasmitted, just because it's a good practice and you are a good GIS person.

## Technical specifications

Formats handled are potentially the entire list of [GDAL](https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/index.html) and [OGR](https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/index.html) but for now I just implemented these ones:

- vectors: shapefile, MapInfo tables, GeoJSON, GML, KML
- rasters: ECW, GeoTIFF, JPEG
- "flat" databases: Esri File GDB, Spatialite
- CAD: DWG (only listing), DXF
- Map documents: Geospatial PDF

DicoGIS is localized in [3 languages (Fran√ßais, Anglais et Espagnol)](https://github.com/Guts/DicoGIS/tree/master/dicogis/locale/) but every one can add a translation or custom the existing texts/labels.

Talking about perforamnces, it's always very dependant on the computer but to give an idea, it needs 30 seconds for:

- 40 vectors,
- 10 rasters (which represent like 90 Mo in total),
- 7 FileGDB contenant sixty vectors,
- and some DXF.

## How to use it

1. Download the latest version:

    - [the executable Windows](https://github.com/Guts/DicoGIS/releases),
    - [source code](https://github.com/Guts/DicoGIS/archive/master.zip).

2. Unzip it and launch DicoGIS.exe / DicoGIS.py

3. Switch language as you need

4. Depending on the kind of data you want to list:

    - For files:

        1. Pick the parent folder where you data is stored: listing starts and progress bar is moving until the end of listing
        2. Choose the expected formats

        ![DicoGIS - Listing](../static/img/02_DicoGIS_Listing.gif "DicoGIS - Listing")

    - For PostgreSQL / PostGIS (database), it's more or less the same story but you have to give the connection settings:

5. Launch and wait: save the output file where you want.

6. Have a look to the output file and apply some Excel enhancements (convert to a newer version if you have, use a default style, etc.)

Optionnaly, check the log file `DicoGIS.log` (there is a lot of information inside it, believe me ^^).

## What about the results?

The output workbook contains technical metadata about the data found, organized in tabs corresponding on the type of data. Have a look to the [matrix I did to see what information according the formats](../misc/formats_matrix.md).
