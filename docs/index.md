## Whats is it?

A self-porting utility that generates a spreadsheet with technical metadata from a geographic data source. Features:

- supports a set of main GIS file formats and PostGIS databases
- serializes results as MS Excel spreadsheet (.xlsx) or JSON files
- (experimental) publish metadata to an [udata](https://github.com/opendatateam/udata) instance (used by the well-known French open data portal <https://data.gouv.fr>)
- usable through a minimalist graphical interface (GUI) or as command-line (CLI)
- open source (Apache 2)
- free to use, not to develop/test/document ([sponsorhips and tips welcome!](./misc/funding.md))
- embeds a version of GDAL/OGR to read data (no reinvented wheel here)
- compatible with various operating systems (official support for Ubuntu LTS and Windows)
- embraces the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) and follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/)

### Use cases

- quick and dirty lookup on data sources (audit...)
- simple knowledge sharing about GIS data
- creating an appendix to a deliverable (study, atlas...) containing geographic data
- publish metadata to external catalog
- starter kit for data governance policy

## Try it

1. Go to the [latest releases on GitHub](https://github.com/Guts/DicoGIS/releases/latest)
1. Below `Assets` dropdown, download the flavor you want: CLI (command-line) or GUI (graphical)
1. Give it permission to run:
    - `chmod +x DicoGIS-*.exe` on Linux
    - tell Windows it's safe (if you think so ;) )
1. Run it
